## Solution
1. **Navigate to the `inhere` Directory:**
   
Start by moving to the `inhere` directory:

2. **Locate the required file:**
   
To locate the file with the required properties in the entire directory, use `find` with options to specify:

- Size (`-size 1033c` for files of exactly 1033 bytes).
- Human-readability (`file` command will verify this).
- Non-executability (`! -executable`).

Run the following command:

```bash
find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
```

This command searches recursively (`.` specifies the current directory) for regular files (`-type f`) that match the size (`-size 1033c`), are not executable (`! -executable`), and returns the filename(s).

3. **Confirm the File is Human-Readable:**
   
Use the `file` command on the located file to verify it is human-readable by running:

```bash
file maybehere07/.file2
```

4. **Read the File to Obtain the Password:**
   
Use `cat` to display the fileâ€™s contents and retrieve the password:
