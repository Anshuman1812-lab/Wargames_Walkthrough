## Solution
1. **Using `find` to Search with Multiple Filters:**
   
Since the file is somewhere on the server, start from the root directory (`/`):

Use `find` with options to filter by owner, group, and file size. The command below will:

- Search recursively from the root.
- Look for files owned by `bandit7` (`-user bandit7`).
- Ensure files are owned by the group `bandit6` (`-group bandit6`).
- Restrict results to files exactly 33 bytes (`-size 33c`):
```bash
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```
The `2>/dev/null` portion suppresses permission errors by redirecting them, making the output easier to read.

This command should return a single file path matching the criteria. Take note of this file path for the next step.

2. **Read the File to Get the Password:**

Use `cat` with the file path to display the fileâ€™s contents and retrieve the password:

```bash
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```
