## Solution
1. **Clone the Repository**
   
As always, start by creating a temporary directory and cloning the repository. Then, move into the cloned repository and analyze the contents.

2. **Check `README.md` Contents**
   
The only visible file is `README.md`. Open it to check its contents:

The `README.md` file doesnâ€™t provide any useful information. Time to dig deeper.

3. **Look for a way in**
   
I tried playing around with git commands to find something valuable. After exploring the logs and branches, something interesting finally showed up.

The repository contains a single tag named `secret`. This looks promising!

4. **Inspect the Tag**
   
Use `git show` to display the details of the `secret` tag:

The tag reveals the password for the next level.
