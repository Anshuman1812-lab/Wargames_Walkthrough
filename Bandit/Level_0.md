## Level Overview
***Bandit Level 0:** https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html*

***Goal:** The objective of this level is straightforward — log into the game server via SSH using the provided credentials.*

***Server:** bandit.labs.overthewire.org*

***Port:** 2220*

***Username:** bandit0*

***Password:** bandit0*

## Solution
To complete this level, follow these steps to establish an SSH connection to the game server. This will involve setting up the connection using the ssh command with the specified host, port, username, and password.

1. **Open Your Terminal:**
   
On Linux or macOS, you can use the default terminal. For Windows, PowerShell works, but using a Linux terminal emulator like Git Bash or WSL is recommended for a smoother experience.

2. **Run the SSH Command:**
   
Type the following command into the terminal:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Here’s a breakdown:

- `ssh` initiates a secure connection.

- `bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org` defines the user and host. bandit0 is the username, and bandit.labs.overthewire.org is the server’s domain.

- `-p 2220` specifies the port number. By default, SSH uses port 22, but here we’re using port 2220 as required by the Bandit server.

3. **Authenticate with the Password:**
   
When prompted, enter ***bandit0*** as the password. Note that the terminal won’t display the password as you type it — this is normal for security reasons.

4. **Confirming Connection:**
   
After entering the correct password, you should see a message like ***Welcome to OverTheWire!*** followed by some text and finally ***Enjoy your stay!***. This indicates a successful login and that you’re ready to move on to Level 1.

Since the task was only to log in, this concludes level 0.
