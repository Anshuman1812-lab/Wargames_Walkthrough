## Solution
1. **List Files in the Home Directory:**
   
Begin by listing the directory contents to verify the exact filename:

You should see the file named spaces in this filename.

2. **Reading the File with Spaces in Its Name:**
   
Similar to the previous level, simply typing `cat spaces in this filename` doesnâ€™t work because the shell interprets each space-separated word as a distinct argument. Here, it sees four separate arguments (`spaces`, `in`, `this`, and `filename`) instead of recognizing them as one filename.

To access a filename with spaces, enclose it in quotes to treat the entire name as a single string:

```bash
cat "spaces in this filename"
```

Alternatively, you can use backslashes (`\`) to escape each space:

```bash
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```

Either approach will output the contents of the file, showing the password for the next level.
