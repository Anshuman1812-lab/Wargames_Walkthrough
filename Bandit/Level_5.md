## Solution
1. **Navigate to the inhere Directory:**
   
Change to the `inhere` directory to access its contents:

2. **Identify the Human-Readable File:**
   
List the contents of the directory. Use the `file` command to examine each file (use `*` to examine all the files of the directory at once) and identify the one that is human-readable. Run:

```bash
file ./*
```

This command will display a list of files with details about each file type. Look for a file labeled as `ASCII text` or `human-readable text`.

3. **Read the Human-Readable File:**
   
Once youâ€™ve identified the human-readable file, use `cat` to display its contents. Since the filenames begin with `-`, the shell interprets it as an option flag. Instead, run:

```bash
cat ./-file07
```

The output will contain the password for the next level.
