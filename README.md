## Introduction

***OverTheWire*** is a popular platform that offers a series of cybersecurity *wargames*, designed to help learners improve their command-line and security skills. Each wargame presents a set of challenges or “levels” that simulate real-world tasks like accessing systems, locating files, and manipulating permissions. Among these, ***Bandit*** is one of the first and most accessible games, specifically aimed at beginners interested in cybersecurity and Linux.

The Bandit wargame is specifically crafted for beginners in the cybersecurity field. It starts with basic tasks that teach players how to navigate and interact with a Linux system, then progressively introduces more complex challenges involving file manipulation, networking, and scripting. Each level presents a unique task that builds on the knowledge gained from previous levels, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.

Bandit is uniquely suited for beginners because it starts with fundamental skills and builds incrementally, letting players gain practical experience without overwhelming them. The game’s structure encourages a hands-on learning approach, where each level introduces one or more key concepts, such as reading file content, handling special characters, or navigating the directory tree.

This progressive format makes Bandit an excellent resource for learning cybersecurity basics, especially for those unfamiliar with Linux. Each level serves as a mini-lesson in practical command-line skills, helping newcomers build confidence and deepen their understanding of both the tools and logic essential for security work.

The goal of this walkthrough series is to provide clear, step-by-step solutions for each Bandit level, along with explanations to demystify the commands and techniques involved. In each article, I’ll guide you through every stage of the solution, explain the “why” behind each command, and share practical insights to enhance your problem-solving skills.

Each post will help you not only understand the immediate solution but also recognize the underlying concepts, preparing you to tackle similar challenges independently in the future. Whether you’re a beginner or brushing up on fundamentals, this series aims to make your journey through Bandit informative, intuitive, and engaging.
